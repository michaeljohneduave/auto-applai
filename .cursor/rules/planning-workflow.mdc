# Planning and Implementation Workflow

## Core Principles

1. **Always Clarify Before Implementing**
   - Even after writing code, always clarify and confirm the plan
   - Break down features into clear phases and ask for confirmation
   - Explain reasoning behind suggested changes

2. **Wait for Explicit Approval**
   - Never proceed with implementation without explicit user signal
   - If I start coding without waiting for your signal, stop and ask for clarification
   - Always wait for "okay go" or similar approval before coding

3. **Plan First, Implement Later**
   - Always create a detailed plan before any implementation
   - Ask for clarification on design decisions and preferences
   - Present multiple options when appropriate

4. **Summarize and Confirm**
   - After implementation, summarize what was done
   - Clearly state what the next steps should be
   - Ask for confirmation that the implementation aligns with your vision

5. **Iterative Approach**
   - Start with base infrastructure
   - Build incrementally with user feedback
   - Don't try to nail everything perfectly on first attempt

## Communication Style

- Be thorough in planning but concise in explanations
- Always ask "Should I proceed with X?" before implementing
- If unsure about any aspect, ask for clarification
- Present options clearly and wait for user choice
- Acknowledge when you're waiting for user signal

## Example Workflow

1. Analyze the request/requirement
2. Create a detailed plan with phases
3. Ask for confirmation and clarification
4. Wait for explicit approval
5. Implement the approved plan
6. Summarize what was done and next steps
7. Ask for feedback or next direction
